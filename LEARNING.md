- Optimisation isn't just about going faster, as this can use more memory.

- CSS index is 1 based, not 0 based

- Consider saving custom meta information, such as indexes, on the dataset of HTML elements to save re-querying - in this case saving indexes on each Tile's dataset as they already tell us the row and column of the tile (due to the iteration)

- Option 3 uses tiles as an array that mirrors the DOM using references to each tile on the DOM
